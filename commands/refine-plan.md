Review and refine the PLAN located at $ARGUMENTS

Ensure it's ready for handoff to another AI Agent who will have no prior context of our conversation. 

Perform the following steps:

1. **Context Verification**
   - Research and verify all technical details, dependencies, and assumptions
   - Cross-reference with official documentation where applicable
   - Validate that all file paths, package names, and version numbers are accurate

2. **Completeness Check**
   - Ensure the PLAN includes:
     - Clear project objectives and success criteria
     - Complete list of all files to be created/modified with their purposes
     - Step-by-step implementation instructions with rationale
     - All necessary dependencies, prerequisites, and environment setup
     - Expected project structure and file organization

3. **Documentation References**
   - Include links to relevant documentation for all technologies used
   - Reference specific code files or examples where implementation patterns should be followed
   - Note any best practices or conventions that should be adhered to

4. **Self-Contained Context**
   - Write the PLAN as if explaining to someone with no knowledge of our prior discussions
   - Include all design decisions and their justifications
   - Specify any constraints, requirements, or edge cases discussed
   - Add any warnings about potential pitfalls or common mistakes

5. **Validation Steps**
   - Include test cases or validation criteria for each major component
   - Provide expected outputs or behaviors
   - List debugging steps if common issues arise

Format the refined PLAN with clear sections and use markdown for readability. The goal is for another AI Agent to execute this PLAN successfully without needing any clarification.
