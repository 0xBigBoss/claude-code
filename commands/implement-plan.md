Read and implement the plan: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these priorities:

1. Create the exact project structure specified
2. Implement highest priority items first
3. Use all code examples, patterns, and technical decisions from the plan
4. Follow the stated technology choices (frameworks, libraries)
5. Create configuration files with sensible defaults
6. Add placeholders (with log warnings) for any external dependencies not yet available
7. Ensure the implementation matches the plan's architecture and goals

Start with core functionality that can be tested/run immediately. Make pragmatic choices where the plan leaves room for interpretation.
