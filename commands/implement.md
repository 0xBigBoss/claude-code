description: Implement plan using sequential TDD and QA subagent flows
---

## Your task

Implement the plan using sequential subagent flows:

1. First, use the @agent-tdd subagent to implement the planned changes following test-driven development practices. Write failing tests first, then implement code to make them pass.

2. After TDD implementation is complete, use the @agent-qa subagent for review and verification. Fix any failing tests, lint errors, type errors, and ensure code quality standards are met.

Ultrathink before you respond. Break down the implementation into clear, verifiable steps. Parallelize the phases of the plan where possible.
